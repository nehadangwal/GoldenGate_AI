# 👤 About the Founder

## Neha Dangwal
**Founder, SentryNode Gateway**

```
 "The metric that matters in 2026 isn't just Accuracy — it's Cost Per Successful Task."
```

## Background

Neha is an AI Infrastructure Architect at the intersection of FinOps and Agentic Security. 
She built SentryNode to solve a problem she identified firsthand: autonomous agents deployed 
without a governance layer create two crises simultaneously — runaway token costs and 
unverifiable model provenance. 

SentryNode's validated benchmarks demonstrate 77.6% cost reduction across 1,000-request 
workloads, with 100% recursive loop interception and 98% semantic quality parity — without 
touching model capability.


## Expertise

- **AI Cost Architecture:** 77.6% unit-cost reduction via patent-pending Adaptive Inference 
  Routing (U.S. #63/982,542). Validated across mixed-complexity enterprise workloads.
- **Agentic Security:** Shadow Mode validation engine and HMAC-SHA256 Sovereign Signatures 
  ensure model parity and cryptographic provenance on every response.
- **Unit Economics:** Pioneered "Atomic Tracking" — per-request, per-user ROI visibility 
  via real-time FinOps ledger, enabling immediate cost-avoidance calculation at scale.


## The Mission

Neha is seeking a **Technical Co-Founder** with a strong engineering foundation and 
the business acumen to own GTM, enterprise partnerships, and fundraising — someone who 
can read the architecture *and* close the deal.

Ideal background: ex-founding engineer, technical product leader, or infrastructure 
operator who has scaled a B2B product from 0→1.
